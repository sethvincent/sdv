Make sure to read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before creating an issue.

Also note that this is mostly a personal tool for creating the files that I need, so I may not address all issues or accept all pull requests.

But if you find it useful and notice improvements that can be made, that's great!

Delete all this text and create the issue after reading the contributing guidelines.
